1.1. Deploy a Wazuh multi-host architecture: the Wazuh manager and Elastic Stack
must run on different servers.

● What problems did you have? on it
● How did you do the installation?
Create 2 VM, locally, in the same network, install elasstic first and then Wazuh. Both Ubuntu vms.

Check daemons on the wazuh manager vm.

1.2. Deploy and connect two agents (Linux and Windows). Use the register service
of Wazuh named “ossec-authd”.

● What port does the registry service listen to?
● What physical file stores the agents' registry information?

1.3 
● Generate events in the agent and verify the generated alerts from the manager.
● Generate an SSH alert in the Linux agent. What is the ID of the generated alert?

1.4 Describe the event flow step-by-step from the time that the event occurs in the
agent to the time the event appears in Kibana.

1.5 How many shards does every index have in this Elasticsearch cluster?

Deliverables:
● Installation screenshots / logs.
